	'This model specifies the behavior of a Loop Disconnect telephone system.

- The only way in which the subscribers telephone communicates with the exchange
  is through raising and lowering the line voltage.

- When the telephone is not in use, the line is held at 0v (volts). When the
  handset is picked up, the line voltage goes to +14v.
  
- The telephone is equipped with an old fashioned rotary dial. While the dial is
  being cocked (i.e rotated to the desired digit) the line is held high.
  
- When the dial is released, it rotates back to its resting position, as it does
  so, a contact is oscillated open and closed. Each time it closes, the line is
  briefly held low. The line is held low for 50 mS (milliseconds) +/- 10 mS for
  each digit position on the dial. For example the digit ''3'' will cause the line
  to go to 0v 3 times. The digit ''0'' is represented by 10 line low events, not
  none.

- The fastest it is possible to dial a digit is one every half second. Between
  dialled digits the line is held high.

- When the subscriber wishes to end the call, he puts the receiver back down and
  the line returns to a low condition.

You may assume that voltage detector hardware filters out any noise on the line
and provides you with an interrupt whenever the line voltage changes; when the
line goes to 14v, a LineHigh interrupt will occur and when the line drops to 0v
a LineLow interrupt will occur.

You may also assume that you can set any timers you need and that the timer will
generate an event you specify when the time expires.

The task is to construct the Line Monitor class and its state model. Solution is
contained in this model.',
